                            <q>We needed help from the team to re&shy;main on top and they did that
                                by run&shy;ning and press&shy;ing high.

                            game. ‘It dropped per&shy;fectly for me and I couldn’t miss,’ he said.
                            ‘I was de&shy;lighted
                            to get a
                            goal, it put
                            us 2-0 up and in the Premi&shy;er League it’s very dif&shy;fi&shy;cult
                            to come
                            back from 2-0
                            down.’

                            Haz&shy;ard was out&shy;stand&shy;ing once more, as he was against
                            Leicester a
                            week ago, and the
                            Bel&shy;gian
                            be&shy;lieves the
                            fact we over&shy;came a strong
                            op&shy;pon&shy;ent was par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly
                            sig&shy;ni&shy;fic&shy;ant. ‘It gives a lot
                            of
                            con&shy;fid&shy;ence,’ he
                            said. ‘We star&shy;ted well and for the fans and us it was
                            a great af&shy;ter&shy;noon.
                            It was a
                            big game
                            and we’ve
                            already lost big games this sea&shy;son against Liv&shy;er&shy;pool and
                            Ar&shy;sen&shy;al,
                            so we did well.

                            ‘We’ve stopped let&shy;ting goals in and nat&shy;ur&shy;ally that breeds
                            con&shy;fid&shy;ence.
                            We need to
                            stay in

                            stay up there. It’s go&shy;ing to be tight un&shy;til the end

                            be&shy;cause there
                            are some
