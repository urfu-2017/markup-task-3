                    cash amount by Hill Valley Police this morning. The theft, which was accomplished with
                    a stolen degaussing unit, took place at the Hill Valley Payroll Substation on 9th Street
                    at exactly 1:28 A.M. this morning. Police were sketchy about details, but apparently McFly
                    set off a pressure sensitive alarm system which alerted authorities. McFly, the son of
                    Martin and Jennifer McFly of Hilldale. accused members of a local gang for putting him up
                    to the crime. Griff Tannen, spokesman for the accused youths, denied any involvement.

            <article class="any-news">
                <p class="first-paragraph">By Matthew Urbanos USA TODAY</p>
                <p class="any-paragraph">A controversial new study by scientists at the International
                    Center for Alternative Scientific Theory (ICAST) suggests that cholesterol may hold the
                    key to curing cancer. The report released yesterday sent shockwaves through the medical
                    community. <q>Simply put, the results of our preliminary research are stunning and
                    completely unexpected,</q> said Dr. Leigh Quindara, leader of the study, in an exclusive
                    interview with USA TODAY. The experimental protocol, according to Quindara and researcher
                    Steve Pearson, involved two groups of rats. The control group was given a normal healthy
                    diet, while the experimental group was given eggs and bacon cooked in lard and smothered
                    in Hollandaise sauce. At the same time, both groups were forced to breathe polluted air
                    Laden with carcinogens that was the equivalent of smoking three packs of cigarettes per
                     day. After 7 months, the control group rats all had lung tumors, while the experimental
                    group did not. The cholesterol levels in the experimental group were 400% greater than the
                    control group. <q>It’s too soon to determine if the cholesterol was a preventative or a
                    cure,</q> said Dr. Stephanie Wissler. President of ICAST. <q>It’s also possible that the
                    difference in tumor occurrence was a result of the higher levels of saturated fat in the
                    experimental group, which would also be startling.</q></p>
                <p class="any-paragraph"><q>It’s been said that everything claimed to be bad for you
                    eventually turns out to be good for you,</q> said <cite>Quindara</cite>, <q>and that would
                    be the case whether the anticancer effect is due to cholesterol or saturated fat.</q> The
                    research suggests numerous ideas for followup studies, and upcoming trials will involve
                    french fries, churros, chicken fried steak and eggnog ICAST will make the detailed data of
                    their study available to anyone who requests it. <q>We want other scientists to replicate
                    our experiments and build upon them to prove that we’re on the right track.</q> said
                    <cite>Pearson</cite>.</p>
                <img src="3.jpg" width="121" height="169" alt="burger" class="photo">
                <p  class="any-paragraph">Reactions to the report were immediate and mostly dismissive,
                    including virulently negative responses from those who did not read it. <q>I don’t have to
                    read a study like that to know that it’s absurd and irresponsible,</q> said cardiologist
                    <cite>Dr. Nakea Tyson</cite>. <q>What are they going to come up with next? Alcohol cures
                    venereal disease? Buttered popcorn improves sexual stamina? This is an organization that
                    exists only to generate news headlines.</q> Dr. Glenann Godden, chief oncologist of United
                    Independent Hospitals, agreed. <q>Consider the source of this research. ICAST is the group
                    that spent five years to determine if rust was actually a living organism of
                    extra-terrestrial origin. I wouldn't be surprised if their study was funded bv the
                    Butterfat Producers of America.</q></p>
                <p class="any-paragraph">Pearson responded that ICAST accepts no funding from special interest
                    groups, businesses or trade organizations. <q>We make all of our reports public to ensure
                    our integrity. and if we’re wrong, well be the first to admit it. As to the McBride Rust
                    Study, it was privately funded and we conclusively proved that rust was not an alien life
                    form. What's so controversial about that? It’s now settled science, and we’ve closed the
                    book on a subject that was the focus of decades of conspiracy theories and barroom
                    brawls.</q></p>
                <p class="any-paragraph">In addition to the varied reactions throughout the medical
                    establishment, the price of pork futures have doubled, and the stock price of Lard Fat
                    Industries of Mobile Alabama (LFIMA) closed at an historic high. <q>We’re certainly not
                    recommending that people suddenly change their diets to a lardinfused cholesterol rich
                    diet,</q> said <cite>Quindara</cite> as she savored a buttered croissant during our
                    interview, <q>but I must admit, few things taste better than a pastry like this.</q> After
                    a pause, she turned to our waitress. <q>Could 1 have another serving of bacon,
                    please?</q></p>
