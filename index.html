                    I first heard of the Beatles when I was ni&shy;ne years old. I spent 
                    most of my ho&shy;li&shy;days on Merseyside then, and a lo&shy;cal girl 
                    ga&shy;ve me a bad pub&shy;li&shy;ci&shy;ty shot of them with their names 
                    scraw&shy;led on the back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't ca&shy;re about that; they we&shy;re the band for me.
                    The fun&shy;ny thing is that pa&shy;rents and all their friends from 
                    Liverpool were al&shy;so cu&shy;rious and proud about this lo&shy;cal group.
                    Prior to that, the peop&shy;le in show bu&shy;si&shy;ness from the north of 
                    England had all been co&shy;me&shy;dians. The Beatles even re&shy;corded 
                    for Parlophone, which was a co&shy;me&shy;dy la&shy;bel, as if they 
                    be&shy;liev&shy;ed they might be a pas&shy;sing no&shy;vel&shy;ty act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was exact&shy;ly the right age to be hit by them full-on. My 
                    ex&shy;pe&shy;rien&shy;ce — seiz&shy;ing on eve&shy;ry pic&shy;ture, 
                    sav&shy;ing mo&shy;ney for sing&shy;les and EPs, catch&shy;ing them on
                    a lo&shy;cal news show — was re&shy;peat&shy;ed over and over again around 
                    the world. It wasn't the first ti&shy;me any&shy;thing li&shy;ke this had 
                    hap&shy;pen&shy;ed, but the Beatles ac&shy;hiev&shy;ed a le&shy;vel of fa&shy;me 
                    and re&shy;cog&shy;ni&shy;ti&shy;on known pre&shy;vious&shy;ly on&shy;ly to 
                    Charlie Chaplin, Brigitte Bardot and Elvis Presley, along with a litt&shy;le of 
                    the air&shy;less ex&shy;clu&shy;si&shy;vi&shy;ty of as&shy;tro&shy;nauts, 
                    for&shy;mer pre&shy;si&shy;dents and ot&shy;her heavy&shy;weight cham&shy;pions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eve&shy;ry re&shy;cord was a shock. Com&shy;pa&shy;red to ra&shy;bid R&amp;B 
                    ev&shy;an&shy;ge&shy;lists li&shy;ke the Rolling Stones, the Beatles 
                    ar&shy;ri&shy;ved sound&shy;ing li&shy;ke not&shy;hing el&shy;se. They had 
                    al&shy;ready ab&shy;sor&shy;bed Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers and 
                    Chuck Berry, but they were also wri&shy;ting their own songs. They ma&shy;de 
                    wri&shy;ting your own ma&shy;te&shy;rial ex&shy;pec&shy;ted, rat&shy;her 
                    than ex&shy;cep&shy;tio&shy;nal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And John Lennon and Paul McCartney were ex&shy;cep&shy;tio&shy;nal 
                    song&shy;wri&shy;ters; McCartney was, and is, a tru&shy;ly vir&shy;tuoso 
                    mu&shy;si&shy;cian; George Harrison wasn't the kind of guitar player who to&shy;re
                    off wild, un&shy;pre&shy;dic&shy;tab&shy;le so&shy;los, but you can sing the 
                    me&shy;lo&shy;dies of near&shy;ly all of his breaks. Most im&shy;por&shy;tant, 
                    they always fit right in&shy;to the ar&shy;ran&shy;ge&shy;ment. Ringo Starr 
                    played the drums with an inc&shy;re&shy;dib&shy;ly uni&shy;que feel that no&shy;body 
                    can real&shy;ly co&shy;py, although ma&shy;ny fi&shy;ne drum&shy;mers have tried 
                    and fai&shy;led. Most of all, John and Paul were fan&shy;tas&shy;tic sin&shy;gers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lennon, McCartney and Harrison had stun&shy;ning&shy;ly high stan&shy;dards as 
                    wri&shy;ters. Ima&shy;gi&shy;ne re&shy;leasing a song li&shy;ke "Ask Me Why" or 
                    "Things We Said To&shy;day" as a B side. They ma&shy;de such fan&shy;tas&shy;tic 
                    re&shy;cords as "Paper&shy;back Wri&shy;ter" b/w "Rain" or "Penny Lane" b/w 
                    "Straw&shy;berry Fields For&shy;ever" and on&shy;ly put them out as sing&shy;les. 
                    The&shy;se re&shy;cords were events, and not just ad&shy;van&shy;ce no&shy;ti&shy;ce 
                    of an al&shy;bum. Then they started to real&shy;ly grow up: simp&shy;le love lyrics
                    to adult stories like "Norwegian Wood," which spo&shy;ke of the sour si&shy;de of 
                    love, and on to big&shy;ger ideas than you would ex&shy;pect to find in 
                    catchy pop ly&shy;rics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They we&shy;re the first group to mess with the aural pers&shy;pec&shy;ti&shy;ve of 
                    their re&shy;cor&shy;dings and have it be more than just a gim&shy;mick. 
                    En&shy;gi&shy;neers li&shy;ke Geoff Emerick in&shy;ven&shy;ted tech&shy;ni&shy;ques 
                    that we now ta&shy;ke for gran&shy;ted, in res&shy;pon&shy;se to the group's 
                    ima&shy;gi&shy;na&shy;tion. Be&shy;fore the Beatles, you had guys in lab coats 
                    doing re&shy;cor&shy;ding ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ments, but you didn't have 
                    roc&shy;kers de&shy;li&shy;be&shy;ra&shy;te&shy;ly put&shy;ting things out of 
                    ba&shy;lan&shy;ce, li&shy;ke a quiet vo&shy;cal in front of a loud track on
                    "Straw&shy;berry Fields Fo&shy;re&shy;ver." You can't exag&shy;ge&shy;rav&shy;te the
                    li&shy;cen&shy;se that this ga&shy;ve to every&shy;one from Motown to Jimi Hendrix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My ab&shy;so&shy;lu&shy;te fa&shy;vo&shy;ri&shy;te albums are Rubber Soul 
                    and Revolver. On both re&shy;cords you can hear re&shy;fe&shy;ren&shy;ces 
                    to other mu&shy;sic — R&amp;B, Dylan, psyche&shy;delia — but it's not do&shy;ne 
                    in a way that is ob&shy;vious or da&shy;tes the re&shy;cords. When you pic&shy;ked 
                    up Revolver, you knew it was some&shy;thing dif&shy;fe&shy;rent. Heck, they are 
                    wear&shy;ing sung&shy;lasses in&shy;doors in the pic&shy;tu&shy;re on the back of
                    the co&shy;ver and not even look&shy;ing at the ca&shy;me&shy;ra...and the 
                    mu&shy;sic was so stran&shy;ge and yet so vi&shy;vid.
                    <span class="statement">
                        If I had to pick a favorite song from those albums, it would be 
                        "And&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Bird&nbsp;Can&nbsp;Sing"... no, "Girl"...no, 
                        "For&nbsp;No&nbsp;One"...and so on, and so on...

                    "A Day in the Life" is the sound of the Beatles on a historic roll. 
                    "It was a peak," John Lennon told Rolling Stone in 1970, recalling the Sgt. 
                    Pepper period. It's also the ultimate Lennon-McCartney collaboration:

                    After their August 29th, 1966, concert in San Francisco, the Beatles 
                    left live performing for good. Rumors of tension within the group 
                    spread as the Beatles released no new music for months.
                </p>

                        "People in the media sensed that there was too much of a lull,

                        They'd say, 'Oh, they've dried up,' but we knew we hadn't."

                    In truth, the song was far too intense musically and emotionally for regular 
                    radio play. It wasn't really until the Eighties, after Lennon's murder, 
                    that "A Day in the Life" became recognized as the band's masterwork. 
                    In this song, as in so many other ways, the Beatles were way ahead of everyone else.

                <p>
                    When the joyous, high-end racket of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" first blasted across 
                    the airwaves, America was still reeling from the November 1963 assassination of 
                    President John F. Kennedy. Beatles songs had drifted across the Atlantic in a 
                    desultory way before, but no British rock &amp; roll act had ever made the slightest 
                    impact on these shores. The Beatles and their manager, Brian Epstein, were 
                    determined to be the first, vowing that they wouldn't come to the U.S. 
                    until they had a Number One record.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The song "was the apex of Phase One of the Beatles' development," said producer 
                    George Martin. "When they started out, in the 'Love Me Do' days, they weren't 
                    good writers. They stole unashamedly from existing records. It wasn't until they 
                    tasted blood that they realized they could do this, and that set them on the road 
                    to writing better songs."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lightning-bolt energy lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky 
                    that many bands who covered the song couldn't figure it out. Lennon's and 
                    McCartney's voices constantly switch between unison and harmony. 
                    Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon's riffing to George Harrison's 
                    string-snapping guitar fills to the group's syncopated hand claps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teens weren't the only ones swept up in Beatlemania. Some of America's greatest 
                    artists fell under their spell. Poet Allen Ginsberg leapt up to dance the first 
                    time he heard "I Want to Hold Your Hand" in a New York club.

                    With advance orders at a million copies, "I Want to Hold Your Hand" was 
                    released in the U.K. in late November and promptly bumped the band's 
                    "She Loves You" from the top of the charts. After a teenager in Washington, 
                    D.C., persuaded a local DJ to seek out an import of the single, it quickly 
                    became a hit on the few American stations that managed to score a copy. 
                    Rush-released in the U.S. the day after Christmas, the song hit Number 
                    One on February 1st, 1964.

                    John Lennon wrote "Strawberry Fields Forever" in September 1966 in Spain, 
                    where he was making the film How I Won the War. Alone, with no Beatles 
                    business for the first time in years, he found himself free to reach deep 
                    for inspiration, going back to childhood memories.

                    Strawberry Field (Lennon added the "s") was a Liverpool children's home 
                    near where Lennon grew up with his Aunt Mimi. When he was young, Lennon, 
                    who had been abandoned by both his parents, would climb over the wall 
                    of the orphanage and play in its wild gardens.
