                                The char&shy;ac&shy;ter grew tre&shy;mend&shy;ously in pop&shy;ular&shy;ity
                                with the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of the first series of short stor&shy;ies in

                                two seri&shy;al&shy;ised nov&shy;els ap&shy;peared un&shy;til 1927. The

                                fi&shy;nal case in 1914. All but four sto&shy;ries are nar&shy;rated by
                                Holmes’s friend and bio&shy;graph&shy;er, Dr John H. Wat&shy;son; two are

                                char&shy;ac&shy;ter of Holmes was in&shy;spired by Dr Joseph Bell, for
                                whom Doyle had  worked as a clerk at the Ed&shy;in&shy;burgh Roy&shy;al
                                In&shy;firm&shy;ary. Like Sher&shy;lock Holmes, Bell was noted for
