		<h3 class="bitter">African Soldiers Tell of Unapproved Mission</h3>
		<p class="first-letter">This article is by Dionne Searcey,
		Helene Cooper and Eric Schmitt</p>
		<p>The Pentagon is trying to determine
		whether American forces involved
		in a deadly ambush in Niger
		this month diverted from their
		routine patrol to embark on an unapproved
		mission, military officials
		said on Friday.</p>
		<p>The questions have come up because
		the American and Nigerien
		soldiers on the patrol have given
		conflicting accounts about
		whether they were simply ambushed
		or were attacked after trying
		to chase Islamic insurgents,
		according to military officials
		from both countries.</p>
		<p>The episode has engulfed the
		White House in crisis and
		prompted demands from members
		of Congress for answers
		about what the soldiers were doing
		before the attack on Oct. 4.</p>
		<p>In interviews with both the Defense
		Department and The New
		York Times, Nigerien military officials
		said that a lightly armed
		convoy of about 50 Nigerien and
		American soldiers gave chase to
		Islamic insurgents on motorcycles
		until the men crossed the
		border into Mali, then returned
		later to ambush the troops.</p>
		<p>American service members, by
		contrast, insisted that they did not
		chase the insurgents but simply
		“noticed” them in the vicinity of
		the village of Tongo Tongo, Defense
		Department officials said. It
		was not until the troops interviewed
		village leaders and were
		on their way to their base, by the
		American account, that the insurgents
		ambushed the convoy, overwhelming
		them.</p>
		<p>The inconsistencies are at the
		heart of why the Pentagon has not
		been forthcoming with details
		about what happened in Niger, according
		to American military officials,
		who spoke on the condition
		of anonymity to discuss a continuing
		investigation. Four Americans
		were killed in the attack, including
		three Green Berets, as well as four
		Nigerien soldiers. Two Americans
		and six Nigeriens were wounded.</p>
		<p>The contradictions added to the
		major questions emerging about
		the attack: Had the soldiers acted
		beyond their planned mission
		without first gaining approval?
		And if they were given permission,
		who granted it?</p>

		<span class="bold">By YAMICHE ALCINDOR and MICHAEL D. SHEAR</span>
		<p><span class="vertical-text">WASHINGTON</span>— Video of a
		2015 speech delivered by Representative
		Frederica S. Wilson revealed
		Friday that John F. Kelly,
		the White House chief of staff, misrepresented

		$20 million for a South
		Florida F.B.I. building and twisting
		President Barack Obama’s
		arm.</p>
		<p>Mr. Kelly, escalating a feud between
		Mr. Trump and Ms. Wilson,
		had cast the congresswoman on
		Thursday as a publicity-seeking
		opportunist. However, the video,
		released by The Sun Sentinel, a
		newspaper in South Florida,
		showed that during her nineminute
		speech, Ms. Wilson never
		took credit for getting the money
		for the building, only for helping
		pass legislation naming the building
		after two fallen federal agents.</p>
		<p>She never mentioned pleading
		with Mr. Obama, and she acknowledged
		the help of several Republicans,
		including John A. Boehner,
		then the House speaker; Representatives
		Mario Diaz-Balart and
		Carlos Curbelo; and Senator
		Marco Rubio.</p>
		<p>Ms. Wilson, in an interview on

		Trump to the widow of a fallen

		can’t even imagine why he would
		fabricate something like that.
		That is absolutely insane. I’m just
		flabbergasted because it’s very
		easy to trace.”</blockquote>

		<h2 class="long-h2">Global City Is the Center of a Secessionist Feud</h2>
		<h3 class="work">Catalan Independence Is Complex Question for Barcelona</h3>
		<p><span class="bold">By PATRICK KINGSLEY</span></p>
		<p>BARCELONA, Spain — These
		days, the city of Barcelona wears
		two hats. And not too comfortably.
		On the one hand, Barcelona is a
		global city, a former host of the
		Olympics, and the home of one of
		the world’s most famous soccer
		clubs, F.C. Barcelona. It is a magnet
		for more than 10 million visitors
		a year, an example of the
		ways large cities increasingly influence
		global politics, economics
		and culture.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, Barcelona is
		the capital of Catalonia, Spain’s
		restive northeastern region, and
		the nerve center of a drive for Catalan
		independence that is described
		by its opponents as parochial,
		exclusive and nationalist.</p>
		<p>In that campaign — which the
		Spanish government now says it
		will take emergency measures to
		halt — there is no place in Catalonia
		with more at stake. In Barcelona,
		the issue of independence
		has provoked exceptionally sharp
		soul-searching and debate over allegiances
		and identity, with an intensity
		not seen since Britain
		voted to leave the European Union.</p>
		<p>In short, people are worried.
		First among them is the city’s leftist
		mayor, Ada Colau, who, despite
		expressing support for independence
		in the past, says she is now
		not in favor of leaving. “It’s a very
		pluralistic city and there is a lot of
		diversity of opinions in Barcelona,”
		she said in an interview
		this week.</p>
		<p>The city is not exactly comparable
		to London — which favored remaining
		in the European Union —
		since Barcelona is still home to
		many separatists.</p>
		<blockquote class="quote">“But if you compare
		it with people in the heart of
		Catalonia,” Ms. Colau said, “it’s
		not as pro-independence.”</blockquote>
		<p>Ms. Colau said she was appalled
		by the violence of the Spanish national
		police as they tried to block
		people from voting in the Oct. 1 independence
		referendum, and she
		believes in Catalonia’s right to
		self-determination.</p>
		<p>But her own attitude to independence
		differs from that of the
		Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont,
		a lifelong separatist from</p>
		<p>Girona, a small city 60 miles
		northeast of Barcelona.
		As an economic powerhouse
		that has welcomed migrants from
		many other parts of Spain, Barcelona
		has a more “cosmopolitan”
		outlook than the rest of Catalonia,
		Ms. Colau said.</p>
		<p>Cities, rather than nation states,
		“are the future,” she said. “I am a
		citizen of Barcelona and a municipalist
		— and that’s the main reason
		that I am in the city hall not
		the Catalan regional government.”
		The region’s Oct. 1 referendum
		was a deeply compromised barometer
		of popular sentiment.</p>
		<p>Though official figures show that
		90 percent of voters supported independence,
		only about 43 percent
		of the Catalan electorate took
		part in a vote that was banned by
		the Spanish courts and which the
		national government tried to stop
		by force.</p>
		<p>Many of those opposed to separation
		had little incentive to brave
		the police violence. Yet a breakdown
		of the results shows that the</p>

		<h2 class="anton">Body Cameras Watch Officers With Little Effect, Study Finds</h2>
		<p><span class="bold">By AMANDA RIPLEY and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS</span></p>
		<p>After a series of high-profile police
		shootings, police departments
		across the nation turned to body
		cameras, hoping they would curb
		abuses. But a rigorous study released
		Friday shows that they
		have almost no effect on officer
		behavior.</p>
		<p>The 18-month study of more
		than 2,000 police officers in Washington
		found that officers
		equipped with cameras used force
		and prompted civilian complaints
		at about the same rate as those
		who did not have them.</p>
		<p>Advocates for body cameras —
		including police officers, lawmakers
		and citizens in high-crime
		neighborhoods — have long argued
		that requiring officers to
		wear the devices would have a
		“civilizing effect” on both officers</p>

		<p>In a lace-accented white wedding

		“There’s nothing like putting on

		<p>After nearly one full term, Ms.
		McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de
		Blasio, has fully wrapped herself
		in the role of political spouse, a job
		especially steeped with symbolism
		for her. As the African-American
		wife of a white mayor in a moment
		of renewed racial strife
		across America, Ms. McCray has
		emerged as likely the most influential,
		if not consequential, first

		small, sitting in on top-level job interviews,
		policy formulation and
		senior staff meetings.</p>
		<p>“Where’s Chirlane?” is a regular

		<figure class="long-img">

		</figure>
		<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — All incoming flights to the United States will 
		be subject to new security screening procedures before takeoff, including both 
		American citizens and foreigners possibly facing security interviews from airline 
		employees, the U.S. government said Wednesday.</p>
		<p>Both American air carriers and global airlines must comply, affecting all the 2,100 
		flights from around the world entering the U.S. on any given day. The directive is 
		far broader than an earlier Trump administration ban on laptops inside the cabins of 
		some airliners, which only targeted 10 Mideast cities and their airlines.
		Confusion greeted the new rules. While five global long-haul carriers said they would 
		begin the new security interviews on Thursday, each offered different descriptions of 
		how the procedure would take place, ranging from a form travelers would be required 
		to fill out to being verbally quizzed by an airline employee. Other carriers insisted 
		their operations remained the same.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="art">
		<blockquote class="quote">“The security measures affect all individuals, international 
		passengers and U.S. citizens, traveling to the United States from a last point of 
		departure international location,” said Lisa Farbstein, a spokeswoman for the U.S. 
		Transportation Security Administration. “These new measures will impact all flights 
		from airports that serve as last points of departure locations to the United States.”
		</blockquote>
		<p>The new rules come at the end of a 120-day window for new U.S. safety 
		regulations to be implemented following the lifting of the laptop ban imposed on some 
		Mideast airlines.</p>
		<p>They include “heightened screening of personal electronic devices” and stricter 
		security procedures around planes and in airport terminals, Farbstein said. She 
		did not elaborate.</p>
		<p>Details of the new rules first became apparent in a statement by Dubai-based Emirates, 
		which operates the world’s busiest airport for international travel.</p>
		<p>In the statement, Emirates said it would begin carrying out “pre-screening interviews” 
		at its check-in counters for passengers flying out of Dubai and at boarding gates for 
		transit and transfer fliers. It urged those flying through Dubai International Airport 
		to allow extra time for flight check-in and boarding.</p>
		<blockquote class="quote">“These measures will work in complement with the current 
		additional screening measures conducted at the boarding gate,” it said.</blockquote>
		<p>Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. said on its website that it had suspended 
		self-drop baggage services and that passengers heading to the U.S. “will be subject to a 
		short security interview” when checking their luggage. Those without bags would have a 
		similar interview at their gates.</p>
		<p>Air France said it would begin the new security interviews on Thursday at Paris Orly 
		Airport and a week later, on Nov. 2, at Charles de Gaulle Airport. It said the extra 
		screening would take the form of a questionnaire handed to all passengers.</p>
		<p>EgyptAir said in a statement the new measures include more detailed searches of 
		passengers and their luggage as well as interviews. It said the procedure would extend 
		to unauthorized agricultural or veterinary products.</p>
		<p>A statement by Germany’s Lufthansa Group said that “in addition to the controls of 
		electronic devices already introduced, travelers to the U.S.A. might now also face short 
		interviews at check-in, at document check or (at their) gate.” Lufthansa Group includes 
		Germany’s largest carrier, Lufthansa, as well as Austrian Airlines, Swiss, Eurowings and 
		several other airlines.</p>
		<p>Royal Jordanian, based in Amman, said it would introduce the new procedures in mid-
		January. Spokesman Basel Kilani said it would take the form of a questionnaire given to 
		passengers before check-in. He said he didn’t know what kind of questions would be asked.
		</p>
		<p>U.S. carriers also will be affected by the new rules. Delta Air Lines said it was 
		telling passengers traveling to the U.S. to arrive at the airport at least three hours 
		before their flight and allow extra time to get through security. United declined to 
		comment, while American did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
		<p>The International Air Transport Association, which represents 275 airlines, did not 
		immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Vaughn Jennings of the trade group 
		Airlines for America said that while the new rules include “complex security measures,” 
		U.S. officials have been flexible.</p>
		<p>“The safety and security of passengers and crew is the highest priority for U.S. 
		airlines and we remain committed to ensuring the highest levels of security are in place 
		throughout the industry,” Jennings said.</p>
		<p>However, not all were convinced of the new measures’ effectiveness.</p>
		<blockquote class="quote">“The part of the new measures I don’t like is that airline 
		personnel are being put back into the security screening process,” said Jeffrey Price, 
		an aviation-security expert at Metropolitan State University of Denver. “Airline ticket 
		agents aren’t always the best at conducting security measures.”</blockquote>
		<p>This is just the latest decision by President Donald Trump’s administration affecting 
		global travel.</p>
		<p>In March, U.S. officials introduced the laptop ban in the cabins of some Mideast 
		airlines over concerns Islamic State fighters and other extremists could hide bombs 
		inside of them. The ban was lifted after those airlines began using devices like CT 
		scanners to examine electronics before passengers boarded planes heading to the U.S. 
		Some also increasingly swab passengers’ hands to check for explosive residue.</p>
		<p>The laptop ban as well as travel bans affecting predominantly Muslim countries have 
		hurt Mideast airlines. Emirates, the region’s biggest, said it slashed 20 percent of its 
		flights to the U.S. in the wake of the restrictions.</p>
