                    <p>Hiroyuki Ito covered a lot of ground this summer: Moji, Dazaifu, 
                        Hakata, Yanagawa and Kumamoto on Japan’s 
                        Kyushu Island; Kochi-city and Cape Ashizuri in Kochi; Atami in Shizuoka 
                        and Omiya, Saitama. 54 cities in 18 prefectures, to be exact.
                        He was looking to capture the way people live outside of Tokyo — the faces, 
                        architecture, even, sometimes, what he sees in a trash can.  
                    </p>    
                    <blockquote>
                        I like to document the small things people do on a daily basis that are not 
                        significant enough to be listed in the history books
                    </blockquote>
                        he said
                    <blockquote>
                        I would like to think that that’s part of history, too, but not in an obvious 
                        or romantic way
                    </blockquote>
                        With that in mind, the Mr.
                    <hr>
                    <p>Ito got in a car with three of his best friends from 
                        elementary school and drove 90 minutes from Tokyo to Atami, a kitschy seaside 
                        city that is a popular destination for family vacations.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        think that’s part of Japanese culture, too
                    </blockquote>
                        he said of the country’s goofier tourist attractions.     
                        In Atami, the photographer and his friends paid about $9 
                        to get into the Trick Art Museum, where visitors can take 
                        photos in trompe l'oeil paintings.
                        Mr. Ito wasn’t fooled by the illusions, but, he said, 
                        “it was so silly that we kind of ended up enjoying it

                    <p class="impr">
                        Mr. Ito made another trip with one of his elementary 
                        school friends to the island of Shikoku. 
                        It required them to spend more than six hours on trains. 
                        A recommendation led them to the Sansuien Hotel, 
                        where they encountered a couple on their wedding day.
                        They were dressed in traditional wedding attire, 
                        complete with the bride’s wataboshi, a hat that protects her hair.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Under it, she most likely has her hair set in the 
                        style called takashimada, the most popular Japanese hairstyle for brides
                    </blockquote>
                        Mr. Ito said.
                    <blockquote>
                        Setting hair in takashimada using your own hair takes a few hours. 
                        If you partially use a wig, then it takes less time.
                    </blockquote>
                        By coincidence, Mr. Ito’s parents-in-law are from Kochi, so he later 
                        asked them if they had heard of Sansuien. “They exclaimed 
                        in unison, ‘That’s where we had our wedding 50 years ago!” he said.

                    referring to the long hours and travel they put in before
                    returning home each day.

                    <p>Mr. Ito spotted this young woman near Omiya Station 
                        in Saitama, a city about 30 minutes outside Tokyo by car. 
                        He wasn’t sure whose face she’d chosen as an accessory,
                        but he imagined it was that of a boy-band member.
                        Reo King Sanshiro, a pantomimist, was standing outside 
                        a Chinese restaurant on a busy street in Kumamoto City. 
                        He told Mr. Ito that he has traveled all over the world 
                        as a street performer. 
                        “There are a lot of street performers that go 
                        study in the West, and they come back and sometimes mix 
                        in Japanese tradition arts too,” Mr. Ito said

                    <p>The young women here are dancing Yosakoi, which originated in the 1950s. 
                        Unlike other styles of traditional Japanese dance, 
                        Yosakoi allows for modern influences. 
                        “When I saw these dancers there, 
                        I actually didn’t know that it was part 
                        of Yosakoi,” Mr. Ito said. “I thought it was a hip-hop scene.”
                        Mr. Ito was struck by the way this man was 
                        wearing his jacket slouched over his shoulders. 
                        It reminded him of Japanese gangster movies in 
                        the ’60s. “It’s a way of saying: 
                        Don’t mess with me. It’s funny because he was not 
                        carrying a gun or a sword — he has a can of coffee.”
                        This photo was taken in Yanagawa, Fukuoka, a town Mr. I
                        to described as Japan’s Venice because of the many canals. 
                        The gondolier pictured is wearing a kasa, or a 
                        traditional Japanese straw hat.
                    </p>
                    <hr>Mr. Ito first met Sachi Matsuoka, above, at the 
                    hot springs in Cape Ashizuri in Kochi. 
                    “Her friends came over and said, ‘Sachi, our bus is leaving 
                    in five minutes, what are you doing? 
                    You make new boyfriends everywhere you go,’” Mr. 
                    Ito said, laughing. The next day, he went to check out the hot 
                    springs in Matsuyama, a three-hour drive away. There, he felt a 
                    tap on his shoulder. It was Sachi.
                    Mr. Ito’s trip ended on a beach in Atami, 
                    where someone was setting off fireworks. 
                    This kind of show is usually a large production in Japan: 
                    Many venues sell tickets in advance, have M.C.s, 
                    invite famous entertainers and require 
                    people to line up for hours for the best spot.
                    <blockquote>We thought that we went to the wrong place 
                        because there were no advertisements saying that fireworks are coming
                    </blockquote>Mr. Ito said. 
                    <blockquote>And then out of the blue, without any fanfare, it started.
                    </blockquote>

                        <p>Japan is a sovereign island nation in East Asia. 
                            Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies off the eastern coast of the 
                            Asian mainland and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk 
                            in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the southwest.

                        <p>Archaeological research indicates that Japan was 
                            inhabited as early as the 
                            Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan 
                            is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. 
                            Influence from other regions, mainly China, 
                            followed by periods of isolation, 
                            particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history.
