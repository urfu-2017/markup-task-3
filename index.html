                <p>
                    A ran&shy;king se&shy;cu&shy;rity of&shy;fici&shy;al in Pnom&shy;penh said he was shocked
                    by news that hun dreds of bo&shy;dies had been seen flo&shy;ating in the Me&shy;kong
                    Ri&shy;ver and that he had or&shy;dered an im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate
                    in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion. He said that no res&shy;pon&shy;sible of&shy;fi&shy;
                    cial had or&shy;dered a mass exe&shy;cution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lieut. Col. Kim Eng Kou&shy;rou&shy;deth, chief of army intel&shy;ligence, said that he 
                    did not know what had hap&shy;pened, but that he ass&shy;umed the dead might have been 
                    the vic&shy;tims of the wrath of a population aroused by the col&shy;lusion between Viet 
                    namese residents of Cambodia and the Viet&shy;cong and North Viet&shy;namese for&shy;ces
                    that had in vaded Cam&shy;bo&shy;dia.

                    A French Ro&shy;man Ca&shy;tholic pri&shy;est in Neak Lu&shy;ong, a town on the Me&shy;
                    kong Ri&shy;ver, es&shy;timated to&shy;day that about <strong>1,000</strong> bo&shy;dies
                    hadflo&shy;ated down&shy;stream since last Mon&shy;day after&shy;noon. 
                    Many of the bo&shy;dies
                    were tied to&shy;gether in groups of up to 10, and many also had their hands&shy;tied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neak Lu&shy;ong is mid&shy;way be tween Pnom&shy;penh, about 40 miles up&shy;stream,
                    and thepo&shy;int at which the Me&shy;kong cros&shy;ses in&shy;to
                    South Viet&shy;nam. No bo&shy;dieshave been seen in the ri&shy;ver at the 
                    ca&shy;pi&shy;tal and as far down stream at the village of Meat Krasar, eight miles
                     down from Pnompenh. The as&shy;sump&shy;tion is,
                    there&shy;fore, that the bo&shy;dies were dumped into the Me&shy;kong in the stretch
                    bet&shy;ween Me&shy;at Kra&shy;sar and here.
                </p>

                    At a mi&shy;li&shy;tary bri&shy;efing in Pnom&shy;penh to&shy;day, Maj. Am Rong
                    said that the Go&shy;vern&shy;ment wanted to pro&shy;tect the rights of in&shy;no&shy;cen
                    &shy;na&shy;mese, but he did not list any se&shy;cu&shy;rity me&shy;asures that
                    had been ta&shy;ken.

                <h3>Sisco Drops Jordan Visit After Anti‐U.S. Riots</h3>
                <p>
                    WA&shy;SHING&shy;TON, Ap&shy;ril 16 (AP)—Jo&shy;seph J. Sis&shy;co, As&shy;sist ant
                    Sec&shy;re &shy;tary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Af&shy;fairs, has
                    de&shy;cided not to visit Jor&shy;dan on his pre&shy;sent tour of the area be&shy;cause
                    of the vio&shy;lent anti‐&shy;American demonstra&shy;tions yester&shy;day in Am&shy;man,
                    the State Depart&shy;ment an&shy;noun&shy;ced to&shy;day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        In view of re&shy;cent de&shy;velop&shy;ments in Jor&shy;dan, Mr. Sisco de&shy;cided
                        to de&shy;fer his plan&shy;ned stop in Am&shy;man
                    </q>
                    , Ro&shy;bert J. McClos key, the depart&shy;ment press of fi&shy;cer, said at a news
                    con&shy;fe&shy;rence. Mr. McClos&shy;key said that this left open the
                    pos&shy;si&shy;bi&shy;li&shy;ty that Mr. Sisco would go to Am&shy;man at ano&shy;ther
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Sis&shy;co is in Is&shy;rael af&shy;ter vi&shy;sits to the Uni&shy;ted Arab Re&shy;pub
                    &shy;lic and Cyp&shy;rus. He had been scheduled to go to Amman to morrow for a one‐day 
                    visit that was to have in&shy;clu&shy;ded a me&shy;et ing with King Hus&shy;sein.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Mr. McClos&shy;key said that the drop&shy;ping of Am&shy;man from
                    Mr. Sis&shy;co's iti&shy;ne&shy;ra&shy;ry was “the on&shy;ly change
                    of plans we know of now.” Mr. Sis&shy;co is
                    plan&shy;ning to go to Bei&shy;rut, Le&shy;ba&shy;non and from there to
                    Te&shy;he&shy;ran, Iran,to at tend a con&shy;fe&shy;ren&shy;ce of Uni&shy;ted
                    Sta&shy;tes am&shy;bas&shy;sa&shy;dors in the Mid&shy;dle East and South Asia

                <h3>The Ultra Secret</h3>
                <p>
                    This bo&shy;ok re&shy;veals the great&shy;est sec&shy;ret of World War II
                    af&shy;ter the atom bomb. It is a must for World War II and 
                    In&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gen&shy;ce buffs.
                    But it has to be re&shy;ad with cau&shy;tion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The Ul&shy;tra Sec&shy;ret" tells how the Bri&shy;tish and the Ame&shy;ri&shy;cans
                    ex&shy;ploi&shy;ted the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion they ob&shy;tai&shy;ned from
                    cra&shy;cking Ger&shy;man mes&shy;sa&shy;ges en&shy;ciphered with a ci&shy;pher
                    ma&shy;chine na&shy;med the "Eni&shy;gma." So valuable was this intelligence that it was
                    given a special security classification, "Ul&shy;tra," which the in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gen
                    &shy;ce it&shy;self came to be cal&shy;led. The author, an R.A.F. of&shy;ficer, was put in
                    charge of distributing Ultra under tight security to Churchill and to commands a&shy;round
                    the world. Win&shy;ter&shy;botham there&shy;fore saw much of the out&shy;put and in this
                    bo&shy;ok has cor&shy;re&shy;lated it with the events of the war.
                </p>
                <p>The sto&shy;ries he tells are re&shy;ve&shy;la&shy;ti&shy;ons.</p>
                <p>
                    Du&shy;ring the Bat&shy;tle of Bri&shy;tain, Ul&shy;tra told the R.A.F. Fighter
                    Com&shy;mand well in ad&shy;vance of ra&shy;dar de&shy;tec&shy;ti&shy;on how ma&shy;ny
                    bom&shy;bers would be thrown a&shy;gainst En&shy;gland and when. This enab&shy;led the
                    Bri&shy;tish to par&shy;cel out their few fight&shy;ers
                    so that so&shy;me would al&shy;ways
                    be a&shy;vail&shy;able to at&shy;tack an oncoming wave.
                    These tactics denied the Germans
                    command of the air over England and con&shy;seq&shy;uent&shy;ly any 
                    pos&shy;sib&shy;ili&shy;ty of in&shy;va&shy;sion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Ju&shy;ly 15, 1928, Po&shy;lish crypt&shy;ana&shy;lysts 
                    no&shy;tic&shy;ed a de&shy;cided
                    change in the let&shy;ter freq&shy;uen&shy;cies of Ger&shy;man ar&shy;my cryp&shy;to
                    &shy;grams, which they were inter&shy;cep&shy;ting. The Poles quick&shy;ly con&shy;clud
                    &shy;ed that the Ger&shy;mans had be&shy;gun using the Eni&shy;gma, which was
                    in&shy;vent&shy;ed and pub&shy;lic &shy;ly sold ear&shy;ly in the 1920's. 
                    Pur&shy;chase of one of the com&shy;mercial mo&shy;dels showed that the Reich&shy;swehr 
                    had al&shy;tered it for sec&shy;re&shy;cy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1932, the Po&shy;lish Biu&shy;ro Szyf&shy;rów 
                    (ci&shy;pher bu&shy;reau) got ad&shy;di&shy;
                    tion&shy;al man&shy;power in the form of three young 
                    mathema&shy;ti&shy;cians. Hen&shy;ryk
                    Zygal&shy;ski, Mann Rejew&shy;ski and Jer&shy;zy 
                    Ro&shy;zyc&shy;ki. They had achiev&shy;ed a
                    par&shy;tial so&shy;lu&shy;tion in their of&shy;fice, 
                    hid&shy;den in the fo&shy;rest of Pyry
                    out&shy;side War&shy;saw, when Po&shy;land's French al&shy;lies fur&shy;nished some key
                    Eni&shy;gma do&shy;cu&shy;ments. Ma&shy;jor Gus&shy;tave Ber&shy;trand of French
                    crypto&shy;gra&shy;phic es&shy;pio&shy;nage had ob&shy;tained them from a Reich&shy;swehr
                    ci&shy;pher unit em&shy;ploye, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, 
                    who wanted mo&shy;ney. (Ber&shy;trand has
                    told this sto&shy;ry in his bo&shy;ok, "Eni&shy;gma.") 
                    With this help, the Poles com&shy;ple
                    &shy;ted their so&shy;lu&shy;tion, and on Ju&shy;ly 26, 1939,
                     pre&shy;sent&shy;ed two re&shy;
                    con&shy;struct&shy;ions of the ma&shy;chine to the French and two to the En&shy;glish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These en&shy;abled the Bri&shy;tish code&shy;break&shy;ing unit at Bletchley, a small
                    town 50 mi&shy;les north&shy;west of Lon&shy;don, to solve the la&shy;ter va&shy;ria
                    &shy;tions of the ma&shy;chine and other ma&shy;chines used for dif&shy;fe&shy;rent
                    bran&shy;ches of the Ger&shy;man armed for&shy;ces. Se&shy;cu&shy;ri&shy;ty for&shy;bade
                    Winter&shy;botham from re&shy;count&shy;ing the&shy;se de&shy;tails, but he pro&shy;per
                    &shy;ly and ge&shy;ne&shy;rous &shy;ly cre&shy;dits the achieve&shy;ment. To gene&shy;
                    ra&shy;te up-to-the-minute so&shy; lu&shy;ti&shy;ons 
                    for these other ma&shy;chines, in&shy;
                    cident&shy;ally, the Bletch&shy;ley ge&shy;niuses e&shy;volved per&shy;haps the first
                    mo&shy;dern e&shy;lect&shy;ro&shy;nic com&shy;puter, which they nick&shy;na&shy;med
                    the "Co&shy;los&shy;sus."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why has this sto&shy;ry re&shy;mained u&shy;der tight wraps so long? It seems that ater
                    World War II, Bri&shy;tain ga&shy;ther&shy;ed up as ma&shy;ny of the tens of thousands of
                    Eni&shy;gmas as she could find and la&shy;ter sold them to so&shy;me of the emer&shy;ging
                    na&shy;tions. Pre&shy;sumab&shy;ly if she could re&shy;ad Eni&shy;gma messa&shy;ges in
                    1940, she could do so in 1950. On&shy;ly re&shy;cent&shy;ly ha&shy;ve the&shy;se
                    count&shy;ri&shy;es re&shy;plac&shy;ed their Eni&shy;gmas with new 
                    crypto&shy;sys&shy;tems.
