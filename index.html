                        LON&shy;DON — Bri&shy;tain’s im&shy;pend&shy;ing exit from the European Uni&shy;on
                        is lead&shy;ing to high&shy;er prices for Apple Mac com&shy;puters here.

                    <p>
                        The tech gi&shy;ant un&shy;veiled a new line of Mac&shy;Books on Thursday
                        and used the op&shy;por&shy;tun&shy;ity to an&shy;nounce price hikes for its
                        oth&shy;er, older Apple Mac com&shy;puters.

                    <p>
                        Apple Mac buy&shy;ers in the U.K. must hand over 20% more — or
                        up to $610 — start&shy;ing Fri&shy;day. It fol&shy;lows a drop in the
                        pound's value against the dol&shy;lar fol&shy;low&shy;ing the coun&shy;try’s

                        The price of one Mac Pro desktop rose from $3,048 (&#163;2,499) to

                        Re&shy;tail stores may know more about you than you think. When you shop at
                        re&shy;tail es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ments these days, you may
                        un&shy;wit&shy;tingly give in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion to the com&shy;pany
                        that can lead to it know&shy;ing more about you than your own fam&shy;ily.
                        Such was the case for a Min&shy;neapol&shy;is fath&shy;er who found out,
                        from Tar&shy;get of all places, that his teen&shy;age daugh&shy;ter was
                        preg&shy;nant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After shop&shy;ping at Tar&shy;get, the girl began re&shy;ceiv&shy;ing mail
                        at her fath&shy;er’s house ad&shy;vert&shy;ising baby items: di&shy;apers,
                        cloth&shy;ing, cribs and oth&shy;er baby-spe&shy;cif&shy;ic products. Her
                        fath&shy;er was in&shy;censed at the com&shy;pany’s at&shy;tempts to
                        “en&shy;cour&shy;age” preg&shy;nancy in teens and com&shy;plained to the
                        man&shy;age&shy;ment. A few days later, a shame&shy;faced Dad called the
                        man&shy;ager to apo&shy;lo&shy;gize; it ap&shy;peared his daugh&shy;ter
                        ac&shy;tu&shy;ally was preg&shy;nant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is not an un&shy;usu&shy;al oc&shy;cur&shy;rence with today’s
                        com&shy;puter-as&shy;sisted data col&shy;lec&shy;tions on the part of
                        re&shy;tail stores. Tar&shy;get as&shy;signs cus&shy;tom&shy;ers a Guest ID
                        num&shy;ber that is tied to their name, cred&shy;it card, email ad&shy;dress
                        and every oth&shy;er piece of in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion the store can
                        col&shy;lect. Us&shy;ing the in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion on past
                        pur&shy;chases, Tar&shy;get is able to cre&shy;ate a start&shy;lingly

                        NEW YORK — While most of the auto in&shy;dustry is fo&shy;cused on get&shy;ting
                        self-driv&shy;ing cars rolling, Uber already has its eyes set to the skies.
                        Lit&shy;er&shy;ally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a white pa&shy;per pub&shy;lished this week, the com&shy;pany de&shy;tailed
                        plans for Uber El&shy;ev&shy;ate, its new di&shy;vi&shy;sion for of&shy;fer&shy;ing
                        rides through fly&shy;ing cars.

                    <p>
                        The com&shy;pany hopes to have the pro&shy;gram up and run&shy;ning with&shy;in

                        Plus with more people in the air, the com&shy;pany an&shy;ti&shy;cip&shy;ates it
                        loosen&shy;ing the bur&shy;den on the roads, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly in
                        heav&shy;ily-con&shy;ges&shy;ted areas.

                    <p>
                        The com&shy;pany ac&shy;know&shy;ledges that there are chal&shy;lenges for
                        get&shy;ting this project off the ground. As op&shy;posed to us&shy;ing
                        heli&shy;copters, which are ex&shy;pens&shy;ive and noisy, the com&shy;pany
                        will in&shy;stead be re&shy;ly&shy;ing on VTOLs, or &quot;a net&shy;work of small,
                        elec&shy;tric air&shy;craft that take off and land ver&shy;tic&shy;ally.&quot;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The VTOLs are cheap&shy;er and quieter, and their elec&shy;tron&shy;ic basis also
                        mean they will bet&shy;ter for the en&shy;vir&shy;on&shy;ment than the gas-powered
                        heli&shy;copters. Bat&shy;tery tech&shy;no&shy;logy still needs to im&shy;prove,
                        and as these are fly&shy;ing vehicles, the com&shy;pany notes there will need to be
                        some air traffic con&shy;trol mech&shy;an&shy;ism in place. These vehicles also will
                        need prop&shy;erly trained pi&shy;lots at the con&shy;trol, at least un&shy;til they
                        too be&shy;come self-driv&shy;ing.

                        Plus there's the eco&shy;nom&shy;ics. This type of fly&shy;ing air&shy;craft, which
                        is already be&shy;ing de&shy;veloped by a vari&shy;ety of com&shy;pan&shy;ies
                        in&shy;clud&shy;ing Joby Avi&shy;ation, Zee.Aero and Air&shy;bus, will be pricey
                        ini&shy;tially, though Uber an&shy;ti&shy;cip&shy;ates that with scale it will
                        drop. For the con&shy;sumer, it sees prices start&shy;ing out high but drop&shy;ping
                        over time thanks to its Uber Pool sys&shy;tem.

                        A 45-mile pool VTOL, for ex&shy;ample, would re&shy;place a 60-mile car ride
                        for po&shy;ten&shy;tially as low as $21. And the trek would only be 15 minutes.
