            <h3>Cambodian Orders Inquiry Into Killings</h3>
            <p>
                A ran&shy;king se&shy;cu&shy;rity of&shy;fici&shy;al in Pnom&shy;penh said he was shocked
                by news that hun dreds of bo&shy;dies had been seen flo&shy;ating in the Me&shy;kong
                Ri&shy;ver and that he had or&shy;dered an im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ate
                in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion. He said that no res&shy;pon&shy;sible of&shy;fi&shy;cial
                had or&shy;dered a mass exe&shy;cution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lieut. Col. Kim Eng Kou&shy;rou&shy;deth, chief of army intel&shy;ligence, said that he did
                not know what had hap&shy;pened, but that he ass&shy;umed the dead might have been the
                vic&shy;tims of the wrath of a population aroused by the col&shy;lusion between Viet namese
                residents of Cambodia and the Viet&shy;cong and North Viet&shy;namese for&shy;ces that had
                in vaded Cam&shy;bo&shy;dia.
            </p>
            <p>
                A French Ro&shy;man Ca&shy;tholic pri&shy;est in Neak Lu&shy;ong, a town on the Me&shy;kong
                Ri&shy;ver, es&shy;timated to&shy;day that about <strong>1,000</strong> bo&shy;dies had
                flo&shy;ated down&shy;stream since last Mon&shy;day after&shy;noon. Many of the bo&shy;dies
                were tied to&shy;gether in groups of up to 10, and many also had their hands&shy;tied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neak Lu&shy;ong is mid&shy;way be tween Pnom&shy;penh, about 40 miles up&shy;stream, and the
                po&shy;int at which the Me&shy;kong cros&shy;ses in&shy;to South Viet&shy;nam. No bo&shy;dies
                have been seen in the ri&shy;ver at the ca&shy;pi&shy;tal and as far down stream at the
                village of Meat Krasar, eight miles down from Pnompenh. The as&shy;sump&shy;tion is,
                there&shy;fore, that the bo&shy;dies were dumped into the Me&shy;kong in the stretch
                bet&shy;ween Me&shy;at Kra&shy;sar and here.
            </p>
            <p>
                At a mi&shy;li&shy;tary bri&shy;efing in Pnom&shy;penh to&shy;day, Maj. Am Rong said that the
                Go&shy;vern&shy;ment wanted to pro&shy;tect the rights of in&shy;no&shy;cent
                &shy;na&shy;mese, but he did not list any se&shy;cu&shy;rity me&shy;asures that
                had been ta&shy;ken.

            <h3>Sisco Drops Jordan Visit After Anti‐U.S. Riots</h3>
            <p>
                WA&shy;SHING&shy;TON, Ap&shy;ril 16 (AP)—Jo&shy;seph J. Sis&shy;co, As&shy;sist ant
                Sec&shy;re &shy;tary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Af&shy;fairs, has
                de&shy;cided not to visit Jor&shy;dan on his pre&shy;sent tour of the area be&shy;cause of
                the vio&shy;lent anti‐&shy;American demonstra&shy;tions yester&shy;day in Am&shy;man, the
                State Depart&shy;ment an&shy;noun&shy;ced to&shy;day.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>
                    In view of re&shy;cent de&shy;velop&shy;ments in Jor&shy;dan, Mr. Sisco de&shy;cided to
                    de&shy;fer his plan&shy;ned stop in Am&shy;man
                </q>
                , Ro&shy;bert J. McClos key, the depart&shy;ment press of fi&shy;cer, said at a news
                con&shy;fe&shy;rence. Mr. McClos&shy;key said that this left open the
                pos&shy;si&shy;bi&shy;li&shy;ty that Mr. Sisco would go to Am&shy;man at ano&shy;ther time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr. Sis&shy;co is in Is&shy;rael af&shy;ter vi&shy;sits to the Uni&shy;ted Arab Re&shy;pub
                &shy;lic and Cyp&shy;rus. He had been scheduled to go to Amman to morrow for a one‐day visit
                that was to have in&shy;clu&shy;ded a me&shy;et ing with King Hus&shy;sein.
            </p>
            <p>

                Mr. McClos&shy;key said that the drop&shy;ping of Am&shy;man from Mr. Sis&shy;co's iti&shy;ne
                &shy;ra&shy;ry was “the on&shy;ly change of plans we know of now.” Mr. Sis&shy;co is
                plan&shy;ning to go to Bei&shy;rut, Le&shy;ba&shy;non and from there to Te&shy;he&shy;ran,
                Iran,to at tend a con&shy;fe&shy;ren&shy;ce of Uni&shy;ted Sta&shy;tes
                am&shy;bas&shy;sa&shy;dors in the Mid&shy;dle East and South Asia on Ap&shy;ril 20 and 21.

            <h3>The Ultra Secret</h3>
            <p>
                This bo&shy;ok re&shy;veals the great&shy;est sec&shy;ret of World War II af&shy;ter the
                atom bomb. It is a must for World War II and In&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gen&shy;ce buffs.
                But it has to be re&shy;ad with cau&shy;tion.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Ul&shy;tra Sec&shy;ret" tells how the Bri&shy;tish and the Ame&shy;ri&shy;cans
                ex&shy;ploi&shy;ted the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion they ob&shy;tai&shy;ned from
                cra&shy;cking Ger&shy;man mes&shy;sa&shy;ges en&shy;ciphered with a ci&shy;pher
                ma&shy;chine na&shy;med the "Eni&shy;gma." So valuable was this intelligence that it was
                given a special security classification, "Ul&shy;tra," which the in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gen
                &shy;ce it&shy;self came to be cal&shy;led. The author, an R.A.F. of&shy;ficer, was put in
                charge of distributing Ultra under tight security to Churchill and to commands a&shy;round
                the world. Win&shy;ter&shy;botham there&shy;fore saw much of the out&shy;put and in this
                bo&shy;ok has cor&shy;re&shy;lated it with the events of the war.
            </p>
            <p>The sto&shy;ries he tells are re&shy;ve&shy;la&shy;ti&shy;ons.</p>
            <p>
                Du&shy;ring the Bat&shy;tle of Bri&shy;tain, Ul&shy;tra told the R.A.F. Fighter
                Com&shy;mand well in ad&shy;vance of ra&shy;dar de&shy;tec&shy;ti&shy;on how ma&shy;ny
                bom&shy;bers would be thrown a&shy;gainst En&shy;gland and when. This enab&shy;led the
                Bri&shy;tish to par&shy;cel out their few fight&shy;ers so that so&shy;me would al&shy;ways
                be a&shy;vail&shy;able to at&shy;tack an oncoming wave. These tactics denied the Germans
                command of the air over England and con&shy;seq&shy;uent&shy;ly any pos&shy;sib&shy;ili&shy;ty
                of in&shy;va&shy;sion.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Ju&shy;ly 15, 1928, Po&shy;lish crypt&shy;ana&shy;lysts no&shy;tic&shy;ed a de&shy;cided
                change in the let&shy;ter freq&shy;uen&shy;cies of Ger&shy;man ar&shy;my cryp&shy;to
                &shy;grams, which they were inter&shy;cep&shy;ting. The Poles quick&shy;ly con&shy;clud
                &shy;ed that the Ger&shy;mans had be&shy;gun using the Eni&shy;gma, which was
                in&shy;vent&shy;ed and pub&shy;lic &shy;ly sold ear&shy;ly in the 1920's. Pur&shy;chase of
                one of the com&shy;mercial mo&shy;dels showed that the Reich&shy;swehr had al&shy;tered it
                for sec&shy;re&shy;cy.

                In 1932, the Po&shy;lish Biu&shy;ro Szyf&shy;rów (ci&shy;pher bu&shy;reau) got ad&shy;di&shy;
                tion&shy;al man&shy;power in the form of three young mathema&shy;ti&shy;cians. Hen&shy;ryk
                Zygal&shy;ski, Mann Rejew&shy;ski and Jer&shy;zy Ro&shy;zyc&shy;ki. They had achiev&shy;ed a
                par&shy;tial so&shy;lu&shy;tion in their of&shy;fice, hid&shy;den in the fo&shy;rest of Pyry
                out&shy;side War&shy;saw, when Po&shy;land's French al&shy;lies fur&shy;nished some key
                Eni&shy;gma do&shy;cu&shy;ments. Ma&shy;jor Gus&shy;tave Ber&shy;trand of French
                crypto&shy;gra&shy;phic es&shy;pio&shy;nage had ob&shy;tained them from a Reich&shy;swehr
                ci&shy;pher unit em&shy;ploye, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, who wanted mo&shy;ney. (Ber&shy;trand has
                told this sto&shy;ry in his bo&shy;ok, "Eni&shy;gma.") With this help, the Poles com&shy;ple
                &shy;ted their so&shy;lu&shy;tion, and on Ju&shy;ly 26, 1939, pre&shy;sent&shy;ed two re&shy;
                con&shy;struct&shy;ions of the ma&shy;chine to the French and two to the En&shy;glish.
            </p>
            <p>
                These en&shy;abled the Bri&shy;tish code&shy;break&shy;ing unit at Bletch&shy;ley, a small
                town 50 mi&shy;les north&shy;west of Lon&shy;don, to solve the la&shy;ter va&shy;ria
                &shy;tions of the ma&shy;chine and other ma&shy;chines used for dif&shy;fe&shy;rent
                bran&shy;ches of the Ger&shy;man armed for&shy;ces. Se&shy;cu&shy;ri&shy;ty for&shy;bade
                Winter&shy;botham from re&shy;count&shy;ing the&shy;se de&shy;tails, but he pro&shy;per
                &shy;ly and ge&shy;ne&shy;rous &shy;ly cre&shy;dits the achieve&shy;ment. To ge&shy;ne&shy;
                ra&shy;te up-to-the-minute so&shy; lu&shy;ti&shy;ons for these other ma&shy;chines, in&shy;
                cident&shy;ally, the Bletch&shy;ley ge&shy;niuses e&shy;volved per&shy;haps the first
                mo&shy;dern e&shy;lect&shy;ro&shy;nic com&shy;puter, which they nick&shy;na&shy;med
                the "Co&shy;los&shy;sus."
            </p>
            <p>
                Why has this sto&shy;ry re&shy;mained u&shy;der tight wraps so long? It seems that af&shy;ter
                World War II, Bri&shy;tain ga&shy;ther&shy;ed up as ma&shy;ny of the tens of thousands of
                Eni&shy;gmas as she could find and la&shy;ter sold them to so&shy;me of the emer&shy;ging
                na&shy;tions. Pre&shy;sumab&shy;ly if she could re&shy;ad Eni&shy;gma mes&shy;sa&shy;ges in
                1940, she could do so in 1950. On&shy;ly re&shy;cent&shy;ly ha&shy;ve the&shy;se
                count&shy;ri&shy;es re&shy;plac&shy;ed their Eni&shy;gmas with new crypto&shy;sys&shy;tems.
