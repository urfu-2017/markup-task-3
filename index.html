                Jared Kush&shy;ner, Pres&shy;id&shy;ent Trump’s

                Though the al&shy;lot&shy;ted time for the grilling had

                they wanted.

                The United States has been at war con&shy;tinu&shy;ously
                since the at&shy;tacks of 9/11 and now has just over
                240,000 act&shy;ive-duty and re&shy;serve troops in at
                least 172 coun&shy;tries and ter&shy;rit&shy;or&shy;ies.
                While the num&shy;ber of men and wo&shy;men de&shy;ployed
                over&shy;seas has shrunk con&shy;sid&shy;er&shy;ably over
                the past 60 years, the mil&shy;it&shy;ary’s reach has 
                not. Amer&shy;ic&shy;an forces are act&shy;ively en&shy;
                gaged not only in the con&shy;flicts in Afgh&shy;anistan,
                Ir&shy;aq, Syr&shy;ia and Ye&shy;men that have dom&shy;
                in&shy;ated the news, but also in Ni&shy;ger and Somalia,
                both re&shy;cently the scene of deadly at&shy;tacks, as
                well as Jordan, Thai&shy;l&shy;and and else&shy;where.
