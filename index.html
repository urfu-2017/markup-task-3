                        <span>C</span>APE CANAV&shy;ERAL, Fla (AP) - The Red&shy;stone rocket which
                        the United States had hoped would boost the first man into space stands on
                        a launch&shy;ing pad here. The So&shy;viet Union beat its firing date
                        by at least two weeks.

                        groom the Red&shy;stone to send one of America's as&shy;tro&shy;nauts on a short
                        suborbital flight, hopefully late this month or early in May.

                    <p>
                        <span>M</span>OSCOW (AP) - A So&shy;viet as&shy;tro&shy;naut has orbited
                        the globe for more than an hour and returned safely to receive the plau&shy;dits
                        of sei&shy;entists and po&shy;lit&shy;ical leaders alike.
                        So&shy;viet an&shy;nounce&shy;ment of the feat brought praise from
                        Pres&shy;ident Kennedy and U.S. space
                        experts left behind in the con&shy;test to put the first man into successful
                        space flight.

                    <p>
                        <span>B</span>y the So&shy;viet account, Maj. Yuri Alekseyvich Gargarin, rode a
                        five-ton space&shy;ship once around the earth in an orbit taking an hour
                        and 20 minutes. He was in the air a total of an hour and 48 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>T</span>he whole sequence of events and the an&shy;nounce&shy;ments
                        relating to it reaised a number of questions. The So&shy;viet an&shy;nounce&shy;ment
                        said the flight took place today be&shy;tween 9:07 and
                        10:55 a.m., but some persons in Moscow's West&shy;ern colony were skeptical
                        that the feat actually came off today.
