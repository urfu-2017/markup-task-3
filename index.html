                        <p>Two Amer&shy;ic&shy;ans, as&shy;tro&shy;nauts of
                            Apollo 11, steered their fra&shy;gile four-legged
                            lun&shy;ar mod&shy;ule safely and smoothly to the
                            his&shy;tor&shy;ic land&shy;ing yes&shy;ter&shy;day
                            at 4:17:40 P.M., East&shy;ern day&shy;light
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Neil A. Arm&shy;strong, the 38-year-old ci&shy;vil&shy;ian
                            com&shy;mand&shy;er, ra&shy;di&shy;oed to earth and
                            the mis&shy;sion con&shy;trol room here:</p>
                        <p><q>Hou&shy;s&shy;ton, Tran&shy;quil&shy;ity Base
                            here. The Eagle has landed.</q></p>

                        <p>The first men to reach the moon&mdash;Mr. Arm&shy;strong
                            and his co-pi&shy;lot, Col. Ed&shy;win E. Ald&shy;rin,
                            Jr. of the Air Force&mdash;brought their ship to
                            rest on a level, rock-strewn plain near the south&shy;west&shy;ern
                            shore of the ar&shy;id Sea of
                            Tran&shy;quil&shy;ity.</p>

                        <p>About six and a half hours later, Mr. Arm&shy;strong
                            opened the land&shy;ing craft's hatch, stepped
                            slowly down the lad&shy;der and de&shy;clared as he
                            planted the first hu&shy;man foot&shy;print on the
                            lun&shy;ar crust:</p>
                        <p><q>That's one small step for man, one gi&shy;ant leap
                            for man&shy;kind.</q></p>

                        <p>His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., as
                            a tele&shy;vi&shy;sion cam&shy;era out&shy;side the
                            craft trans&shy;mit&shy;ted his every move to an

                        <p>Mr. Arm&shy;strong's ini&shy;tial steps were tent&shy;at&shy;ive
                            tests of the lun&shy;ar soil's firm&shy;ness and of
                            his abil&shy;ity to move about eas&shy;ily in his
                            bulky white space&shy;suit and back&shy;packs and un&shy;der
                            the in&shy;flu&shy;ence of lun&shy;ar grav&shy;ity,
                            which is one-sixth that of the earth.</p>
                        <p><q>The sur&shy;face is fine and powdery,</q> the as&shy;tro&shy;naut
                            re&shy;por&shy;ted. "I can pick it up loosely with
                            my toe. It does ad&shy;here in fine lay&shy;ers like
                            powdered char&shy;coal to the sole and sides of my
                            boots. I only go in a small frac&shy;tion of an
                            inch, maybe an eighth of an inch. But I can see the
                            foot&shy;prints of my boots in the treads in the
                            fine sandy particles.</p>

                        <p>After 19 minutes of Mr. Arm&shy;strong's test&shy;ing,
                            Col&shy;on&shy;el Ald&shy;rin joined him out&shy;side
                            the craft.</p>
                        <p>The two men got busy set&shy;ting up an&shy;oth&shy;er
                            tele&shy;vi&shy;sion cam&shy;era out from the lun&shy;ar
                            mod&shy;ule, plant&shy;ing an Amer&shy;ic&shy;an
                            flag in&shy;to the ground, scoop&shy;ing up soil and
                            rock samples, de&shy;ploy&shy;ing sci&shy;entif&shy;ic
                            ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ments and hop&shy;ping and lop&shy;ing

                        <p>They found walk&shy;ing and work&shy;ing on the moon
