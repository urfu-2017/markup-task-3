                    George McFly, local author and professor, was shot dead last night en&nbsp;route
                    to&nbsp;an&nbsp; award dinner by&nbsp;the Hill Valley Civic Committee.

            <p>
                McFly, who was to&nbsp;receive an&nbsp;award, was found dead in&nbsp;an alley 2&nbsp;blocks
                from
                the HV&nbsp;Community Center at&nbsp;9:35 p.m.&nbsp;by&nbsp;police.
                There were no&nbsp;witnesses. Police speculate that robbery was the motive
                as&nbsp;McFly&rsquo;s wallet was missing. McFly, a&nbsp;lifelong resident of&nbsp;Hill Valley,
                had long been a&nbsp;civic activist against the policies of&nbsp;BiffCo. He&nbsp;is survived
                by&nbsp;his wife, Lorraine, and their three children, David, Linda and Martin. Funeral
                arrangements have not yet been made.

                <p>
                    An&nbsp;article of&nbsp;faith among current educational reformers is&nbsp;that American
                    schoolchildren do&nbsp;not do&nbsp;enough homework.
                </p>
            </section>
            <p>
                The obvious corollary is&nbsp;that more
                homework will lead to&nbsp;higher achievement.

                Both of&nbsp;these assertions have now been challenged in&nbsp;the first issue of&nbsp;The
                Harvard Education Letter, a&nbsp;newsletter intended to&nbsp;synthesize the research
                on&nbsp;current educational topics.

                &laquo;When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;homework, more is&nbsp;not necessarily better,&raquo; said
                Helen Featherstone, the editor. &laquo;Elementary schoolchildren probably spend too much time
                on&nbsp;homework, and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;what they do&nbsp;is&nbsp;busywork.
                Homework is&nbsp;certainly a&nbsp;good idea in&nbsp;high schools, but a&nbsp;lot
                of&nbsp;thought has to&nbsp;go&nbsp;into making it&nbsp;worthwhile.&raquo;

                With the reform of&nbsp;public education a&nbsp;political issue in&nbsp;virtually every state,
                the value of&nbsp;homework as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teaching device has attracted growing national
                attention.

                <h2>Robert Pittman begins a new music channel</h2>
                <p>
                    As&nbsp;a&nbsp;17-year-old program director for a&nbsp;small radio station
                    in&nbsp;Mississippi in&nbsp;the early 1970&rsquo;s, Robert W. Pittman
                    did what came naturally.
                </p>

            <p>
                He&nbsp;made his selections for the station according to&nbsp;his personal preferences.
                But the results were disastrous. The audience in&nbsp;rural Mississippi wasn&rsquo;t
                interested in&nbsp;listening to&nbsp;The Steve Miller Band and other underground rock groups
                of&nbsp;the time, and the station&rsquo;s ratings plummeted.

                Out of&nbsp;that early failure, Mr. Pittman, now executive vice president and chief operating
                officer of&nbsp;MTV Networks Inc., said that he&nbsp;learned a&nbsp;valuable lesson: &quot;
                In&nbsp;programming it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;terrible error to&nbsp;play only what you like.&quot;
                It&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;axiom that Mr. Pittman has applied as&nbsp;the mastermind of&nbsp;MTV,
                or&nbsp;Music Television, the 24- hour rock-and-roll cable channel widely regarded as
                television&rsquo;s most inventive new form, and more recently in&nbsp;devising VH-1,
                (for Video Hits One), MTV&rsquo;s new cousin for an&nbsp;older audience. VH-1&nbsp;is
                a&nbsp;24-hour music channel aimed at&nbsp;viewers aged 25&nbsp;to&nbsp;54&nbsp;that begins
                today and will be&nbsp;available to&nbsp;more than 3&nbsp;million cable television
                subscribers. Neither of&nbsp;New York City&rsquo;s cable systems is&nbsp;carrying
                VH-1&nbsp;yet, although systems in&nbsp;such areas as&nbsp;Fort Lee, N.&nbsp;J.,
                will be&nbsp;showing&nbsp;it.

                A&nbsp;73-year-old conservative millionaire actor was re-elected President. And along the
                elite social circuit labor leaders became so&nbsp;chic you couldn&rsquo;t have a&nbsp;really
                good party without one.
                Having tried poverty, the 60&rsquo;s rebels found that the late, great Sophie Tucker was
                right: Rich is&nbsp;indeed better. Yippies became urban professional Yuppies and upwardly
                mobile Yumpies. They dressed for success, and sought their fortunes the competitive,
                acquisitive and capitalist way. As&nbsp;always, money was everything.
