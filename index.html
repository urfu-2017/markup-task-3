                        In 2016, researchers from the California Institute of Technology presented evidence 
                        that the ninth planet - with an orbital period of 15 000 years - does exist beyond 
                        the orbit of Neptune. At the moment, the existence of the ninth planet remains 
                        hypothetical, but astronomers have calculated that its orbit is huge. If Planet X 
                        does exist, it is approximately 2-15 times heavier than Earth and is from the Sun 
                        at a distance of 240,000,000,000 kilometers.

                            On April 8, 2016, private company SpaceX carried out a successful vertical 
                            landing of the missile. For the general director of the company "SpaceX", 
                            Elona Mask, this goal remained a priority for many years. Despite the fact 
                            that the achievement belongs to a private enterprise, the technology of 
                            vertical landing will be available to government agencies like NASA so that 
                            they can move forward in space exploration.

                            The ancient molecule, GK-PID, caused unicellular organisms to evolve into 
                            multicellular organisms about 800 million years ago. It was found that the 
                            GK-PID molecule acted as a "molecular carbine": it collected the chromosomes 
                            together and fixed them on the inner wall of the cell membrane when the division 
                            occurred. A fascinating discovery indicates that the ancient version of GK-PID 
                            behaved earlier than it does now. The reason why it turned into a "genetic 
                            carbine" is associated with a small genetic mutation that reproduced itself. 
                            It turns out that the origins of multicellular life forms is the result of one 
                            particular mutation.

                            In 2016 scientists discovered a “quasi-satellite” of our planet, which named 
                            HO3. It orbits the sun in such a way that the space rock never strays too far 
                            from Earth. The asteroid’s exact size is unknown, but researchers believe that 
                            it is between 130 feet and 330 feet wide.
                            The asteroid poses no threat to earth, and never gets closer than 9 million 
                            miles to our planet.

                                In January 2016, mathematicians opened a new prime number in the framework 
                                of the "Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search". This is 
                                2<sup>74207281</sup> - 1. Modern cryptography uses Mersenne's prime numbers 
                                to decipher encoded information. 2<sup>74207281</sup> at the moment is the 
                                longest of all existing prime numbers (it is longer than its predecessor by 
                                almost 5 million digits). The total number of digits that make up a new 
                                prime number is about 24,000,000.

                            At the moment there is no way that would allow storing data on one device for a 
                            really long period of time.
                            Or does it exist?
                            Recently, scientists from Southampton University made an amazing discovery. They 
                            used nano-structured glass in order to successfully create a process of recording 
                            and retrieving data. The storage device is a small glass disk the size of a 
                            25-cent coin, which is capable of storing 360 terabytes of data and is not 
                            affected by high temperatures (up to 1000 degrees Celsius). The average 
                            shelf-life at room temperature is about 13.8 billion years (about the same time 
                            there is our universe). The data is recorded on the device using an ultrafast 
                            laser by means of short, intense light pulses.
