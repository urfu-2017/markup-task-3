                        Geostorm review – Gerard Butler's dull disaster movie is a washout
                    </span>
                    <span class="article-text">
                        When writer-director Dean Devlin titled his handsomely budgeted new action tentpole
                        Geosstorm, he entered into an unspoken pact with his prospective audience. He chose a
                        goofy, make-believe word, and in doing so, promised a goofy, make-believe movie.
                        Nobody’s walking into the auditorium looking for lofty insights on the complexities of
                        the human condition, or even a commentary on how the timebomb that is climate change
                        continues ticking away due to political gridlock. It ain’t Citizen Kane and it ain’t
                        An Inconvenient Truth, and there’s no sport in expecting it to be. All parties
                        involved should understand the terms of this tacit agreement, an “if you build it,
                        they will come” proposition in which “it” refers to nothing short of a natural
                        apocalypse. All Devlin needed to do was deliver a storm, and no ordinary storm – a
                        storm of geo-proportions. To put it in the parlance of our times, you had one job. Is
                        climate change Hollywood's new supervillain? Read more Imagine, then, a re-edit of
                        Jaws in which Richard Dreyfuss and company get word from authorities at sea that a
                        shark is on the way to savage their precious shores. They then spend most of the film
                        doing everything in their power to prevent the shark’s arrival, and though Spielberg
                        occasionally cuts to reveal a sliver of fin, they successfully ward off the leviathan
                        before the beach turns bloodbath. Devlin lets out minute-long dribs and drabs of
                        Mother Gaia’s terrible might, torching Hong Kong here and drowning Abu Dhabi there,
                        but viewers take heed: there is no full-blown geostorm in Geostorm. We have been sold
                        a false bill of goods. If Devlin had his act together where the storm is concerned,
                        viewers might be willing to overlook such trivial matters as pat characterization, a
                        ludicrous plot and stale dialogue. But he doesn’t earn a tenth of the goodwill it’d
                        take to get away with a creation as absurd as Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler). A
                        hard-living single dad with a taste for booze and a distaste for the pencil-necked
                        bureaucrats’ rules, he’s the usual “cop on the edge” type, except that he’s an
                        astronaut. Step aside, John Glenn, because Jake’s the dudeliest dude Nasa has ever
                        seen; not only does he have perfect five o’clock shadow at all times, he invented a
                        global network of satellites codenamed “Dutch Boy” that artificially controls the
                        planet’s atmosphere and halted global warming in its tracks. This, believe it or not,
                        goes awry.

                        Can Michael Fassbender survive his year of flops?
                    </span>
                    <span class="article-text">
                        The Snowman is a turkey. Everyone saw it coming, and now it’s happened. Audiences
                        simply did not want to see Michael Fassbender play a man called Harry Hole in a film
                        that was released before it was finished and marketed by a drawing of a Snowman who
                        calls everyone “Mister Police”, like some sort of cut-price children’s entertainer.
                        Lessons have been learned and everyone will move on. Especially Michael Fassbender.
                        The Snowman has been a rare blip in an otherwise sparkling career for him. That is,
                        unless you count that terrible Assassin’s Creed film he made. Oh, and the compulsively
                        underpowered Alien: Covenant. And Song to Song, a Terrence Malick film so Terrence
                        Malicky that even Terrence Malick promised to stop making films like that now. And The
                        Light Between Oceans and Trespass Against Us, two films that nobody – not even the
                        handful of people who actually paid to see them – have thought about since the instant
                        the credits rolled. The trouble is that all these films have been released within the
                        last 12 months. Michael Fassbender is now churning out a fresh disappointment every
                        eight weeks; a frequency that makes Nicolas Cage look like Daniel Day-Lewis. It’s
                        enough to make you wonder what went wrong.

                        Director James Toback accused of sexual harassment by 38 women
                    </span>
                    <span class="article-text">
                        The Oscar-nominated writer and director James Toback has been accused of sexual
                        harassment by 38 women in a report published by the Los Angeles Times. How Harvey
                        Weinstein’s accusers gave women worldwide a voice Read more Many of the women allege
                        Toback approached them on the streets of New York City and promised stardom.
                        Subsequent meetings would often end with sexual questions and Toback masturbating in
                        front of the women or dry-humping them, according to the accounts. The 72-year-old
                        denied the allegations to LA Times, saying he never met any of the women, or if he had
                        it “was for five minutes and [I] have no recollection”. Thirty-one of the women spoke
                        on the record including Louise Post, who is a guitarist and vocalist for the band
                        Veruca Salt, and the As the World Turns actor Terri Conn. Actor Echo Danon recalled an
                        incident on the set of Toback’s film Black and White where he put his hands on her and
                        said he would ejaculate if she looked at his eyes and pinched his nipples. “Everyone
                        wants to work, so they put up with it,” Danon told the Times. “That’s why I put up
                        with it. Because I was hoping to get another job.” Toback did not respond to a request
                        for comment.

                    <span class="article-text">
                        It was a close call for a family in Abbotsford Wednesday morning as fire crews rushed
                        to save a dog trapped inside a house fire. When crews arrived to the home at Laburnum
                        Avenue and Old Clayburn Road flames were shooting out of the roof. Firefighters burst
                        into the home to try and find the family dog. Crews got him out just in time and
                        immediately gave it oxygen. The dog is expected to be OK but the damage to the home is
                        extensive. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. “They were able to find
                        the house pet,” said Abbotsford Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Adams. “The dog was brought
                        out, the dog was unconscious when they brought him out. We were able to give him
                        oxygen and revive him and he’s doing pretty well.” The dog was also checked out by a
                        vet.

                    <span class="article-text">
                        Five days after firefighters stopped responding to medical emergencies in Greater
                        Manchester an off-duty officer has saved a life. John Wheeldon, arrived at his local
                        gym today (Friday) and within 10 minutes was bringing a fellow gym-goer back to life
                        with CPR. The Bolton North Blue Watch firefighter said: “I arrived at the gym at
                        around 8.40am and started my warm up on the cross trainer. “I could see another man
                        five machines down with his headphones on, listening to music. One minute the man was
                        working out and the next he was lay on the floor.” John rushed to his aid performing
                        chest compressions. Within one minute, an ambulance had been called and two members of
                        staff from Total Fitness gym in Bolton were by his side with a defibrillator. John
                        added: “I ran over to the man and I could tell by the colour of his face that he
                        wasn’t breathing. I pulled his body away from the machines so I had room to perform
                        CPR. I continued with chest compressions whilst one staff member gave breaths and the
                        other operated the defibrillator. “We continued doing CPR for around six minutes
                        before he started breathing on his own but he was under the recommended breaths per
                        minute and then stopped breathing again. At this point the AED advised a shock, which
                        he received just as the ambulance service arrived.”

                    </span>
                    <span class="article-text">
                        The Catalan parliament will meet on Thursday to decide how to respond to the Spanish
                        government’s unprecedented decision to impose direct rule, as speculation mounts that
                        the regional president, Carles Puigdemont, could use the occasion to ask MPs to vote
                        on a unilateral declaration on independence. The plenary session will be held a day
                        before the Spanish senate is expected to approve measures that would strip
                        Puigdemont’s administration of its powers and transfer its functions to the relevant
                        ministries in Madrid. The constitutional measures would require elections for the
                        Catalan parliament to be held within six months. On Monday the Catalan foreign affairs
                        minister, Raül Romeva, said the region would not accept the Spanish government’s
                        attempts to take control, and accused the EU of doing nothing. “How can the European
                        Union live with that situation [if this happens]?” Romeva told BBC Radio 4’s Today
                        programme. “How can the EU democracy survive and how can they be credible if they
                        allow this to happen? Because what I can tell you is that the people and the
                        institutions in Catalonia will not let this happen.” Spain’s deputy prime minister,
                        Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, said the Spanish government would appoint its own
                        representative to replace Puigdemont as soon as direct rule came into effect. “They
                        are president of the regional government and senior figures in that government because
                        of the constitution,” she told Spain’s Onda Cero radio station. “They are not
                        entrusted with that role by any divine authority.” On Saturday Spain’s prime minister,
                        Mariano Rajoy, said his government was using article 155 of the constitution to
                        “restore the rule of law, coexistence and the economic recovery and to ensure that
                        elections could be held in normal circumstances”. Puigdemont’s government has
                        denounced the move as a “de facto coup d’etat” and insists the results of a recent
                        referendum – in which 90% of participants voted for independence – mean it has a
                        mandate to break away from Spain and become a sovereign republic. Although the Catalan
                        leader signed a declaration of independence on 10 October, he then proposed that its
                        effects be suspended for two months to allow talks to find a way out of the impasse.
                        Puigdemont has described Madrid’s invocation of 155 as the worst attack on Catalonia’s
                        institutions since General Franco’s dictatorship, and accused the Spanish government
                        of “slamming the door” on his appeals for dialogue. His government has refused calls
                        to avert the crisis by dropping his independence plans and calling new elections
                        before the article comes into force. On Sunday a spokesman for the Catalan
                        administration said fresh polls were “not on the table” and the government would fight
                        “tooth and nail to defend Catalonia’s democratically elected institutions”.
                        Puigdemont’s junior coalition partner, the far-left, separatist Cup party, has urged a
                        campaign of mass civil disobedience against what it called “the greatest aggression
                        against the civil, individual and collective rights of the Catalan people” since
                        Franco. According to the Catalan government, about 2.3 million of Catalonia’s 5.3
                        million registered voters – 43% – took part in the referendum, and 770,000 votes were
                        lost after Spanish police stepped in to try to halt the vote.

                        Forget Los Angeles. If you want to get rich and famous fast, in anything from food to
                        fashion, San Francisco is the place to be. But will handing that kind of power to a
                        new global elite come at a price?

                        The strangest thing about Bulletproof Coffee isn’t stirring a pellet of grass-fed
                        butter and a dollop of coconut oil into your morning cup and calling it breakfast,
                        weird though that is to swallow. No, what makes Bulletproof really unusual is the
                        trajectory the trend has followed. The craze started with the Silicon Valley
                        entrepreneur Dave Asprey, who turned the alleged weight-shedding, brainpower-enhancing
                        benefits of caffeine turbocharged with fat into a mini-empire. He took the idea to
                        Santa Monica, where he opened a cafe. David Beckham started dropping in. From there,
                        it spread to fashion. Vogue has called it “the new green juice”; at the recent fashion
                        shows, it was on the way to replacing espresso and egg-white omelette as the standard
                        front-row breakfast. Dan Brown, whose novels surely give him zeitgeist bragging
                        rights, has been telling interviewers how 4am writing sessions for his latest book,
                        Origin, were fuelled by Bulletproof. Asprey’s ready-made, cold-pressed Bulletproof
                        products are about to go on sale in Whole Foods Market stores, at which point the
                        journey from Silicon Valley quirk to bona fide hipster lifestyle trend will be
                        complete. The direction of travel of trends outwards from Silicon Valley was visible
                        when Duncan Selbie, the chief executive of Public Health England, warned of the
                        “perils of sitting at your desk” all day and called for employers to introduce
                        “walking meetings” to reduce stress and back pain among the workforce. The pioneer of
                        the walking meeting was Steve Jobs and the habit is so deeply ingrained in Silicon
                        Valley culture that the Frank Gehry-designed Facebook headquarters features four
                        hectares of wifi-enabled wildflower meadows, with milkshake stands dotted along paths.
                        On Prince Street in New York’s Soho, the newest boutique to open alongside Marc Jacobs
                        and Ralph Lauren is evidence of the first true fashion trend to originate in Silicon
                        Valley. Allbirds, the woollen sneakers that are already de rigueur at Googleplex, are
                        spreading to “a creative class of people … architects, interior designers,
                        entertainers in music and acting”, as the San Francisco-based cofounder Joey
                        Zwillinger told the New York Observer.
