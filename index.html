                        Google just concluded its I/O 2017 keynote, where executives led 
                        by CEO Sundar Pichai laid out the company’s future roadmap for Android, 
                        Google Assistant, Google Home, virtual reality, and much more. The 
                        company has settled into a pattern of releasing information about what 
                        it’s doing (and what it wants to do) for developers at I/O, instead of 
                        trying to wow consumers or the press.

                    <p>
                        Android’s mobile dominance hasn’t stopped growing. CEO Sundar Pichai 
                        revealed at the keynote’s start that the tally of monthly active Android 
                        devices now exceeds 2 billion.

                    <p>
                        Google Assistant can now analyze the world around you with the help of your 
                        smartphone camera. Using a technology the company calls Google Lens, the 
                        Assistant will analyze your surroundings and display relevant content on 
                        your screen.

                        <h4>GOOGLE HOME TURNS INTO A PHONE</h4>
                        <p>
                            Like Amazon, Google is turning its smart speaker into a phone. Over the 
                            coming months, all Home owners will be able to place free calls to the 
                            United States and Canada. By default, Google uses a private number for 
                            this feature — but you’ve got the option of tying it to your own mobile 
                            phone number. The same goes for everyone else in your house, as phone 
                            calls support Home’s multi-user setup. Only outgoing calls will be available 
                            at launch, as Google is taking a cautious approach to avoid privacy headaches.
                        </p>
                
                        <h4>HOME GETS WAY MORE USEFUL</h4>
                        <p>
                            Google’s smart speaker was already one of the best ones on the market, but 
                            the company announced a suite of other new features and updates beyond calling 
                            to Home that make it much more powerful. Home is now going to be able to control 
                            HBO Now, Hulu, SoundCloud, Deezer, and more. Even better, Google is opening up 
                            access to Home’s Bluetooth radio, meaning you can treat it just like any other 
                            Bluetooth speaker.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        HOME NOW ACTS AS A PHONE, CAN CONNECT OVER BLUETOOTH, AND GETS NEW 
                        COMPATIBILITY WITH SERVICES LIKE HBO AND HULU
