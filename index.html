                    The Food and Drug Ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion (FDA) has re&shy;called 465,000
                    pace&shy;makers after dis&shy;cov&shy;er&shy;ing se&shy;cur&shy;ity flaws that could

                    A pace&shy;maker is a small elec&shy;tric&shy;al bat&shy;tery-op&shy;er&shy;ated device
                    that's sur&shy;gic&shy;ally im&shy;planted in the chest of pa&shy;tients to help
                    con&shy;trol their heart&shy;beats. The device uses low-en&shy;ergy
                    elec&shy;tric&shy;al pulses to stim&shy;u&shy;late the heart to beat at a nor&shy;mal
