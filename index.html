                <p>It is the first time the Blues have gone four league games
                    without con&shy;ced&shy;ing since

                    one of the
                    back-three,
                    Gary Cahill, both put that down to a con&shy;cer&shy;ted ef&shy;fort
                    over the full

                <p>
                    <q>We are de&shy;fend&shy;ing well</q> noted Alonso.
                    <q>We needed help from the team to re&shy;main on top and they did that
                        by run&shy;ning and press&shy;ing high.
                        Start&shy;ing from the goal&shy;keep&shy;er
                        to the striker we
                        are do&shy;ing a
                        great job
                        de&shy;fens&shy;ively and this is how we have to

                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>It was a tough game. Southamp&shy;ton star&shy;ted
                        very well, press&shy;ing high, and we had a little
                        dif&shy;fi&shy;culty but
                        in the end we played a great game and we are very happy with
                        the per&shy;form&shy;ance of the team.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Southamp&shy;ton’s re&shy;cord at home is very good and we had to dig
                        in at
                        times,</q>
                    agreed
                    Cahill. We have
                    worked hard in train&shy;ing. Every play&shy;er has worked hard on the
                    shape the
                    man&shy;ager has
                    brought
                    in and we are
                    get&shy;ting the re&shy;wards, but it is al&shy;right hav&shy;ing the
                    shape, it is
                    also to do with
                    hav&shy;ing the
                    play&shy;ers with
                    the men&shy;tal&shy;ity to go out and do the busi&shy;ness when we need
                    to.

                    <q>We have the flair play&shy;ers to go out and cre&shy;ate and score
                        goals, but
                        we also

                        dig in and
